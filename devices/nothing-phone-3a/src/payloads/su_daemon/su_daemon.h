 * The seam between the su daemon proper and the two things that are not it.
 *
 * One helper binary is built and the application ships that one copy in its
 * APK for every target, so nothing here may know which device it is running
 * on. What used to sit in su_daemon.c and did know is now separated out:
 *
 *   late_load.c  everything that knows KernelSU exists. The KMI and the
 *                manager package are the target's, and arrive as arguments
 *                rather than being compiled in.
 *   hold_refs.c  the kernel-page reference holder, which exists for core66
 *                alone and is dead weight on any other core.
 *
 * su_daemon.c is then a plain su daemon: a protocol, a uid check, and exec.
 * It reaches the two above through the entry points at the bottom of this
 * file and knows nothing else about either.
