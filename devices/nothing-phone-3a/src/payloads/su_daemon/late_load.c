 * Loading KernelSU into a running kernel, and nothing else.
 *
 * This is the whole of what the helper knows about KernelSU. It was in
 * su_daemon.c, where it carried two values that belong to a target rather than
 * to a helper shipped once for all of them:
 *
 *     execl(..., "late-load", "--kmi", "android15-6.6",
 *                "--package-name", "me.weishu.kernelsu", NULL);
 *
 * ksud embeds one module per KMI and picks by the name it is given, so that
 * literal silently loaded nothing on any kernel that was not android15-6.6 --
 * a device failure, in a value that could not be seen from the device. They
 * are now required arguments. src/targets.json carries both per target, the
 * feed passes them to the application, and the application passes them here;
 * no default is kept, because a default is what the mistake was.

 * ksud runs it is already too late to read its own image.)
 *
 * Nothing in this repository put that file there. The application does, right
 * before it asks for a late-load, so the application route worked and the adb
 * shell route could not: ksud stopped at "Failed to stage ksud ... No such
 * file or directory", the module was never loaded, and no daemon stayed
 * resident. Measured on Quest 3, which is the first target driven from a shell
 * far enough to reach this.
 *
 * Staged here instead, so the two routes cannot disagree about it. Copied from
 * KSUD_PATH rather than trusting whatever is already at the staged path,
 * because KSUD_PATH is the file the bind mount below makes ksud, and the
 * binary that installs itself has to be the binary that ran -- a leftover
 * .ksud-stage from an earlier attempt with a different build would otherwise
 * be what ends up at /data/adb/ksud. The application writes both from one

 *
 * Everything below reports with dprintf to the caller's stdout and stderr,
 * which arrive here as descriptors passed over the socket and which belong to
 * adbd. Writing to them from the daemon's own domain is already a denial --
 * `scontext=u:r:kernel:s0 tcontext=u:r:adbd:s0 tclass=fd { use }`, recorded
 * while the exploit still had SELinux permissive. ksud then reloads the policy
 * as part of loading the module, enforcing comes back, and from that moment
 * every dprintf in this file is dropped. The operation silences its own
 * reporting halfway through, and it does it just before the part worth
 * reporting.
 *
 * The status goes the other way: su_daemon.c hands it to send_response on the
 * daemon's own socket, and the client returns it as its exit code. That is the
 * one channel the reload cannot touch, so the status is the report, and
 * su_late_load_report() below is what turns it back into a line -- printed by
 * the client, in the caller's own domain, where writing to the caller's stderr
 * is never in question.
 *
 * KSUD is a band rather than one code because ksud's own exit status used to
 * be returned raw, where it collided with every code here: an exit code of 13
 * could be this file's "driver fd unavailable" or ksud exiting 13, and nothing

 * repaired in su_daemon.c.
 *
 * The payload repairs this once already, right after the write: a policy
 * reload runs security_load_policycaps(), which rewrites the whole array from
 * the policy. Measured on warhol, that reload is faithful and idempotent --
 * three round trips leave the policy byte-identical in size and every
 * capability unchanged -- but it happens while the exploit is still running,
 * and a run has been seen where the array was corrupt again by the time
 * anything looked. So it is done again here, where "again" costs a 1.6 MB
