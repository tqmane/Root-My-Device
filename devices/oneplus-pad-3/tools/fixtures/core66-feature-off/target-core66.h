/* OPPO PMG110 — ColorOS 16.0.8 (PMG110_16.0.8.300 CN01), MT6991 / Dimensity 9400
 *
 *   kernel 6.6.118-android15-8-g93e223c276e7-abogki500782043-4k  (GKI, 4K pages)
 *   build  OPPO/PMG110/OP61E5L1:16/BP2A.250605.015/...:user/release-keys
 *
 * Build with:  make TARGET=pmg110
 *
 * Everything here was derived from the stock OTA boot.img by
 *   python3 tools/extract_device.py boot.img --name pmg110
 * except P0_KERNEL_PHYS_LOAD, which comes from preloader_raw.img (see below).
 *
 * The futex-PI bug is present in this build. remove_waiter() is out-of-line at
 * image offset 0x01077ff4 and operates on `current` (mrs x20, sp_el0; then
 * `str xzr, [x20, #0x938]` for pi_blocked_on) rather than on waiter->task, and
 * rt_mutex_start_proxy_lock+0x44 calls it on the failure path. That is the
 * unfixed shape of CVE-2026-43499; the stable fix first shipped in 6.6.140 and
 * this kernel is 6.6.118. The same disassembly re-confirms FAKE_TASK_PI_LOCK_OFF
 * (0x90c), FAKE_TASK_PI_WAITERS_OFF (0x920), FAKE_TASK_PI_BLOCKED_ON_OFF (0x938)
 * and WAITER_LOCK_OFF (0x58) below.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: only main.c re-points the *_OFF macros at the
 * runtime known_offsets[] table. fops.c, root.c, util.c, pipe.c and slide.c
 * use the compile-time values from here, so a device on a different kernel
 * series needs its own target.h, not just an offsets.h entry.

/* Physical address the bootloader loads the kernel Image at.
 *
 * MT6991 lk does not carry this as a compiled-in constant — it takes the
 * address from the mblock allocator, which lk populates from the memory map
 * the preloader hands over in the PL2LK boot tag. So it is not in lk.img and
 * not in boot.img. It *is* in the preloader: `preloader_raw.img` embeds the
 * memory-layout table that seeds mblock, and its `mb_kernel` region start is
 * the kernel load address.
 *
 *     mb_kernel  0x0080000000  size 0x07c80000  align 0x10000
 *
 * read with the MediaTek preloader parser from the warhol port. That same
 * derivation (`mb_kernel.start` -> P0_KERNEL_PHYS_LOAD) is what the MT6993
 * port used, and it was confirmed correct there against a real device, which
 * is the only reason it is trusted here rather than left unset.
 *
 * The value is identical in the two firmware revisions checked
 * (16.0.8.300 / A.19 and 16.0.9.400 / A.20 — all 12 layout entries match), so
 * it is a per-SoC-config constant, not a per-build one.
 *
 * Note that it lands exactly on the DRAM base, i.e. P0_KERNEL_PHYS_DELTA == 0.
 * The SM8845 devices in this tree sit 0x28000000 above theirs; that difference
 * is expected, not a sign of a misread table.
 *
 * QEMU (tools/qemu_verify.py --mode linear) settles the other half: booting
 * this kernel with five KASLR seeds / RAM sizes / PA widths leaves
 * memstart_addr equal to the DRAM base every time — arm64's linear-map
 * randomisation never fires at VA_BITS=39. So the physmap alias is
 * KASLR-independent and this is one fixed number per firmware.
 *
 * To check it against a running device, or to override without a rebuild:
 *     adb shell su -c 'grep -i "Kernel code" /proc/iomem'
 *     GHOSTLOCK_PHYS_LOAD=0x... /data/local/tmp/a/e
